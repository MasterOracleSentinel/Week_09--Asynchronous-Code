Evaluate the benefits and pitfalls of asynchronous programming techniques
-------------------------------

So far in the course, you’ve worked with several asynchronous coding techniques: setTimeout, setInterval, callbacks, promises, and async and await. These techniques may all seem similar at first, but it is important to understand their benefits and pitfalls as you write complex programs. 

Instructions:

Select one asynchronous coding technique that you have used (setTimeout, setInterval, callbacks, promises, or async/await) and respond to the following questions:

* Did you notice any of the pitfalls when you used this technique? If so, what happened?
* What is one thing you will consider before using this technique again in the future?
* Share an example that would be an ideal use case for this technique. 

If you need further clarification on asynchronous programming, review MDN’s Introducing Asynchronous JavaScript resource:
