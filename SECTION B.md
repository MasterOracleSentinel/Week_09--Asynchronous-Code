2. Practice communicating technical decisions you’ve made
6. Build and manipulate maps on web pages

This week, you developed an animation that displays a city bus location in real-time. This activity involves three steps, where you will refactor the project, share it on your GitHub repository, and write a discussion post describing your work. 

1. Refactor The Real Time Bus Tracker
It’s time to experiment with the project and make it your own by refactoring the code. You might consider:

Using data from another public API
Adapting the styling
2. Share Your Real Time Bus Tracker Repository
After you’ve made these improvements, share the link to your GitHub repository in the discussion board below. To align with your GitHub Portfolio Project, it should include at least three files: index.html, mapanimation.js, and styles.css. It should also include a README file with:

Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker
Description of the project: What does the current project do?  Include improvements you made in the description. 
How to Run: This is information someone would use to run your project on their machine.
Roadmap of future improvements: What additional features or functionality would be helpful to a user? 
License information: This should include information about the MIT license. 
3. Respond To The Following In A Discussion Post:
What improvements did you make when refactoring the project?
Why did you choose to make these changes?
What did you find challenging about the refactoring process?
Share a screenshot of your map. 
Hint: If you need further clarification review Dr. Sanchez's videos on map animation, which showcase several examples of the overall structure of a program that moves a marker through several bus stops.
